# Captive Portal Control

Currently, this module can either completely disable Android's captive portal, or change it to use a URL provided by Kuketz (a security and privacy researcher) instead of Google.
It is planned to also allow you to manually chose a URL.

## Installation

You can install this module from Magisk, or from recovery, such as TWRP.
When flashing, you use your device's volume keys to select what option you want to enable.
This module also includes auto update, so you can select **Update** if using Magisk to reflash an updated version from this git. 

**Get _Captive Portal Control_ [from Github](https://github.com/tsukimio/captive-control/releases).**
